# Exploratory Data Analysis of Retail Store using Power BI

# Objective

•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is crucial in understanding and analyzing data, especially in retail stores.

•	The main objective of this project is to explore the dataset provided, extract the key insights with the help of data visualization, and find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.

# Tool used 

•	Power BI as Power BI is a powerful tool for visualizing and exploring data.

# Dataset

•	Sample Superstore

# Steps were taken to build the Dashboard

•	Imported all the data in Power BI

•	Performed Data Transformation using Power Query Editor

•	Started building Dashboard

# I've used the following visuals to represent the data

•	 3 Cards representing KPIs - Total quantity, Total sales and Total profit.

•	 Used Donut chart, funnel chart, Area chart, and clustered column chart for visualizing region, segment, category, subcategory-wise profit, 
   and stacked bar char for segment and category-wise sales.

•	 Added 2 slicers to filter data based on city and ship mode.

•	 Used Map visual to indicate how profit varies through each state in the United States.


# Some Important Insights from the Dashboard

•	After analyzing and visualizing the data we concluded that:

•	The West region has the highest profit of 108.42K (37.86% of total profit) whereas the Central region has the lowest profit of 39.71K (13.86% of total profit).

•	Consumer segment has the highest profit of 134.12K which comprises around 47% of total profit.

•	The Technology category generates the highest profit of 145K followed by Office suppliers, Furniture.

•	The top 5 Sub-categories acquiring the maximum profit are Copiers, Phones, Accessories, Paper, and Binders.

•	The Sub-categories of Supplies, Bookcases, and Tables have suffered losses.

•	The top 5 states which generate maximum profit are: California, New York, Texas, Washington, Pennsylvania.

•	The Standard class ordered the highest quantity which is 23K which generated sales of 1.4M and a profit of 164K.

# Recommendations

•	To increase the overall sales and profit, we should pay attention to the sub-categories that have suffered losses 
  i.e. Supplies, Bookcases, and Tables, and the Furniture category which has the lowest percentage of profit.

•	We can also work on improving the profit by focusing on the Central region which has the lowest profit amount.
